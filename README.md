# Lifetimed

Lifetimed is a JavaScript library for creating application using Lifetime concept. It is a close to production port from Kotlin codebase.

## Structure

The library consists of several packages: `@lifetimed/core`, `@lifetimed/browser`, etc. The core library contains all the core primitives and the base logic of litimes. All other packages are wrappers around common used API and popular libraries.

## What is Lifetime?

Lifetime is a powerful concept that allows developers to easily handle clean up logic in their applications. With Lifetime, developers can easily manage the lifetime of objects and resources, ensuring that they are properly disposed of and freed up when they are no longer needed. This can help to prevent memory leaks and improve the overall performance and stability of the application.
